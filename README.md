# Learning

Working on this project taught me the importance of debugging and problem-solving. For example, I struggled with SPA routing issues in React (Single Page Application navigation problems) and making the app fully responsive across devices. I kept trying different approaches, learning from mistakes, and finally finding the right solutions.

This project showed me how real-world apps behave differently once users interact with them — it’s never perfect at first. Each challenge became a learning opportunity, and I’m continuously improving myself day by day, project by project.
